Magpie is my slightly-more-than-hobby programming language. It's been through a
few forms. The current one is [here](https://github.com/munificent/magpie).
This is the second version of it, when it was single-dispatch and had an
optional (self-hosted) static type system.

No active development is going on here. It's preserved for
historical/entertainment purposes.
